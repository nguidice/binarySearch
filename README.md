# binarySearch
This repository contains a simple implementation of the binary search algorithm in C++. The program efficiently searches for specific values within a sorted array using the binary search technique. The Binary search algorithm is known for its efficiency, operating in O(log n) time complexity, which makes it ideal for searching through large datasets.  

Sample Input:  
  6 # The number of pre-sorted numbers  
  3

  999  
  4 # The number of query numbers  
  51  
  999  
  7  
  458  

Sample Output:  
  Not found
